  <div class="about-me">
    <p>Hi, I'm Justin Harrison. I graduated from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 2014 with a high honors degree in Art. Before that, I studied Cognitive Science at the University of Georgia. My interests primarily revolve around computation, cognition, art, and the big questions that humanity must answer in light of the Anthropocene.</p>
    <p>I live in Pasadena, California, but am currently in Mexico City brushing up on my Spanish. When I'm not working, you can find me exercising, watching boxing, playing Bloodborne, obsessing about the zombie apocalype, or reading Don Quijote en espa√±ol.</p
